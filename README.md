# Compound Ores

## Summary

Compound Ores is a Minecraft Forge mod that aims to spice up your mining expeditions. It adds a wide variety of compound
ores--ores that contain two ores within--that will randomly replace some blocks in ore veins.

## Current Status

**Very work-in-progress.** Please do not use this expecting a finished, fully-working product. As a rule-of-thumb, if
the version string includes `dev` or `alpha`, then that's a good sign not to use it for a proper playthrough.

## Bucket List

(higher up the list = higher priority)

* Allow ore components to be defined via datapacks rather than hardcoding them
* Allow the end user to configure world generation
* Test compatibility with other mods
* Write proper documentation
* Port to 1.17
* Port to Fabric
* Port to 1.12
