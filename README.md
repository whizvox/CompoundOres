## Summary

Compound Ores is a Minecraft Forge mod that aims to spice up your mining expeditions. It adds a wide variety of compound
ores--ores that contain two ores within--that will replace blocks in random ore veins.

## Current Status

**Work-in-progress.** Still need to thoroughly bug test and add support for many more ores.

## Bucket List

* Support many different ores from many different mods
* Write proper documentation
* Port to 1.17
* Port to Fabric
* Port to 1.12
